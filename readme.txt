This plug-in has changed name after recieving a 1 star review from someone who thought I had stolen and update anothers plug-in.
Wordpress accepted its initial name which lead me to think that it was unique. I am sorry for anyone else who had this. I would like
to thank however people who noticed it as a mistake and did not rate 1 star for an innocent plugin. 

If you know of any plug-ins that use the same name as mine please email me and i will change its name as soon as i can.

If you are having difficulties getting this plugin to work please email me with the details
